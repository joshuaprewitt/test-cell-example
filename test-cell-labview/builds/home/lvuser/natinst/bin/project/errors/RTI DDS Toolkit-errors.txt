<nierror code="5001">
RTI DDS Toolkit found an error status in the input error cluster. It might be due to an error in the previous stage.

Check that the type of all transferred/received data is the same and is similar to the one connected to the data type in the Create Reader/Writer subVIs.

<nierror code="5003">
It is likely that another application is still using an entity of that Participant. Close all the instances before trying to delete the contained entities.

<nierror code="5006">
Loading QoS from XML file the QoS setting format is incorrect or does not match with any of the ones existing in the XML file. Check that format is correct (Library::Profile), the XML file exists, and it contains a correct configuration.
</nierror>
<nierror code="5007">
Possible error in the QoS configuration. You can also use the default configuration by attaching an empty string as input to the CreateReader/Writer subVI. This might be caused because there is no active network interface in the system. If the monitoring library is being used, it needs to be in the PATH.
</nierror>
<nierror code="5008">
This might be caused by an unused entity that has not been released. Close the current VI and release unused entities using the Release Unused Entities" subVI (in RTI DDS Toolkit, Tools). Then re-open the current VI.
</nierror>
<nierror code="5009">
Possible error in the QoS configuration. If it is a Custom Security Profile, check that it exists. Otherwise check that format is correct (Library::Profile), the XML file exists and it contains that profile. You can also use the default configuration by attaching an empty string as input to the Create Reader/Writer subVI.
